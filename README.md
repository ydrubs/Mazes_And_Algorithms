# Mazes_And_Algorithms-
A text exchange with ChatGPT to create a simple maze game and learn about the depth-first-search Algorithm 

The original prompt to ChatGPT was "Show me how to generate a maze using pygame graphics." ChatGPT generated the maze using Depth-First Search algorithm. This led to a serious of exchanges with ChatGPT that branced off into two different paths:
 - 1) Creating a simple game to navigate a maze
 - 2) Understadning what a Depth-First Search algorithm is and how to implement it.

The code generated by the original prompt is shown as maze_generator.py
The first sub folder contains the development of the maze game using continued exchanges with ChatGPT. 
The goal is to keep the game itself relatively simple in order to go through the code and learn how to implement the various features. 

The second subfolder contains the development of the Depth-First Search algorithm in order to understand its structure and application.
